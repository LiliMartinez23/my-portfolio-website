                <h3>HEY EVERYONE</h3>
                <p>Hello, I'm Liliana, a senior at Texas A&M University - San Antonio, 
                    pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. 
                    Alongside my studies, I'm a student worker on the university's 
                    Web Team, which allows me to further explore web development with my teams and independently. 
                    In addition to my academic and professional commitments, I practice Jiu Jitsu every week to 
                    maintain my health and stay in shape.
                </p>
                <p>My interests extend beyond my field of study such as nutrition, reading, and 
                    architecture. Nutrition has been an important aspect of my life at the beginning of 
                    COVID-19, since then I've been a vegatarian for nearly three years continuously improving 
                    my physical and mental well-being.
                </p>
                <p>Another one of my priorties is reading. Initially, reading did not appeal to me until 
                    I realized I hadn't found the right genres that matched my interests. After 
                    exploring various subjects, I developed a profound interest in science, social networking, 
                    and business literature. Recent reads, such as "Never Eat Alone" by Keith Ferrazzi, 
                    "Elon Musk" by Walter Isaacson, and "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, have greatly influenced 
                    my perspective and approach to life.
                </p>

            <!-- <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
                <p>Being a vegatarian indeed has its limitations, but it also comes with some perks, like cooking!
                    I really enjoy cooking! Not only do I get to make food, but there's also some creativity that takes place.
                    As a vegatarian, it gives me the opportunity to explore new foods and spices, while also maintaining 
                    a healthy diet.

            <h3>TRAVEL</h3>
                <p>I cannot express the beautiful places I've been to! I could not believe my eyes what the world 
                    looks like at different times of the year. Traveling is an experience I think a lot of people need.
