                This topic might not interest many folks, but it's one I think many people should hear and possibly consider. 
                I was not a vegetarian my entire life. I grew up eating all kinds of meats, ranging from hotdogs to hamburgers.
                Although I loved it, it didn't occur to me until my junior year of high school that I should rethink my diet. At the time of 
                junior year, COVID-19 had spread throughout the world and locked everyone in their homes for three years. During that
                time I spent my days watching a YouTuber, Emma Chamberlain. Emma was the one who introduced me to healthy eating. She was a 
                vegan her whole life, which inspired me to give it a try. To be fair, it was not easy. Emma made it look simple, granted 
                she was vegan her whole life and I wasn't, but I wasn't giving up. Instead of immediately changing my diet, I decided to 
                slowly transition into becoming a vegetarian.
