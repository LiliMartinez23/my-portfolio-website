                    This topic might not interest many folks, but it's one I think many people should hear and possibly consider. 
                    I was not a vegetarian my entire life. I grew up eating all kinds of meats, ranging from hotdogs to hamburgers.

                    Although I loved it, it didn't occur to me until my junior year of high school that I should rethink my diet. At the time of 
                    junior year, COVID-19 had spread throughout the world and locked everyone in their homes for three years. During that
                    time I spent my days watching a YouTuber, Emma Chamberlain. Emma was the one who introduced me to healthy eating.

                    She was a 
                    vegan her whole life, which inspired me to give it a try. To be fair, it was not easy. Emma made it look simple, granted 
                    she was vegan her whole life and I wasn't, but I wasn't giving up. Instead of immediately changing my diet, I decided to 
                    slowly transition into becoming a vegetarian.
